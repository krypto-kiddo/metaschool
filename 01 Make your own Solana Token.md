# My First SPL token
Launched on the Devnet. Guided by Metaschool. 

Emotions are too much to handle man, I just wanna go back to being a workaholic when I didnt care about the world and always put work first.
Anyway, I felt bored and aimless, decided to polish my skills while I take my time to find motivation again. 
Hence, this Metaschool series was born. 

First quest : Made my first, own Solana SPL token and deployed it on devnet. 

No codes to see here, just steps and CLI commands.
Requirements : Rustc , Solana CLI, Cargo, Solana Tool Suite.

EXPLANATION BEGINS BELOW

(Gosh this file gives off vibes of a school lab report)

First, we make a Solana Wallet using the cmd line tool 
``` solana-keygen new --force -o "D:\Solana\test.json" ```
